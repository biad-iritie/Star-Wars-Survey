# Star Wars Survey

After the increase audience of *Star Wars*, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) try to reply to this question : **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**.
So the team collect data addressing this question by survey *Star Wars Fans* using online tool SurveyMonkey. The result of tis collect is [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

The data has several columns, including:

- RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
- Gender - The respondent's gender
- Age - The respondent's age
- Household Income - The respondent's income
- Education - The respondent's education level
- Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location
- Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response
- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.

In this project we're going to clean and explore this data to see what we can find out.
